Tornom: Anonymous Bittorrent In The Cloud

1) create EC2 instance with bootstrap_chef.sh as user_data
2) run deploy_chef_env.rb ec2_public_hostname
3) follow login instructions
4) visit tornom on the web
5) download stuff on port 80
6) terminate instance and get email report of your EC2 bill

A lot of these step are not yet implemented.
Work in progress. This is a chef cookbook for a torrent download/seed/download system in the cloud. The intended deploy
target is Amazon EC2. I'll be working in this repository and improving things in public.

Bootstrapping is done with the included scripts. Ubuntu is pretty stupid with it's dependence on sudo and how that
effects paths and aliases. I've printed a snarky message for now.
